Constructors:
-> It is block of code similar to method
-> at the time of calling constructor, memory for object is allocated in memory
-> special type of method used to initialize object
-> java compiler provides default constructor by default

Types of constructors:
1. default/ no-arg constructor
2. parameterized constructor

Rules for creating java constructor:
-> constructor name must be same as its class name
-> must have no explicit return type
-> can't be abstract, static, final, synchronized

Default constructor:
-> doesn't have any parameter
-> purpose is to provide default values to object like 0,null etc depending on the type

Parameterized constructor:
-> used to provide different values to distinct objects

Constructor overloading:
-> It is technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists
-> each constructor performs different task

this keyword:
-> 'this' is reference variable that refers to current object

Usage of 'this' keyword:
1. used to refer current class instance variable
2. used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
3. used to invoke current class constructor
4. can be passed as argument in method call
5. can be passed as argument in constructor call
6. used to return current class instance from method
