Inheritance:
-> Mechanism in which one object acquires all properties and behaviors of a parent object
-> Idea behind is that we can create new classes built upon existing classes
-> represents IS-A relationship also called parent-child relationship

Why Inheritance?
1. for method overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved)
2. for code reusability

Terms used:
1. class
2. subclass/ child class / derived class/ extended class
3. super class/ parent class/ base class
4. reusability

'extends' keyword:
-> it indicates that new class is made that derives from existing class
-> extends - to increase the functionality

Types of Inheritance:
1. single
2. multi-level
3. hierarchical
4. multiple
5. hybrid

Single Inheritance:
-> when a class inherits another class

Multilevel Inheritance:
-> when there is a chain of inheritance

Hierarchical Inheritance:
-> when two or more classes inherits a single class
