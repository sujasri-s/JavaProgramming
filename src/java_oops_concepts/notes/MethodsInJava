Method:
-> It is collection of instructions that performs a specific task
-> It provides reusability of code

Method declaration:
1. access specifier - public/ private/ protected/ default
2. return type
3. method name
4. parameter list
5. method body
(1,2,3,4 - method header and 3,4 - method signature)

Types of Method:
1. predefined method
2. user-defined method

Static method:
-> method that belongs to class rather than instance of class
-> main advantage is that we can call it without creating object
-> It is invoked by using class name

Instance method:
-> It is non-static method defined in the class
-> It is invoked by using instance of class
-> 2 types of Instance method - accessor and mutator

Accessor method:
-> Methods that reads the instance variables
-> It is prefixed with word 'get'
-> also called getters
-> returns value of private field

Mutator method:
-> Methods that reads the instance variables and also modify the values
-> It is prefixed with word 'set'
-> also called setters/ modifiers
-> doesn't return anything
-> used to set value of private field

Abstract method:
-> This method doesn't have method body i.e., without implementation
-> always declared in abstract class

Factory method:
-> Method that returns object to class to which it belongs
-> all static methods are factory methods
