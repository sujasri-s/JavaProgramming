Polymorphism - Method overloading:
-> if a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters

Advantage of method overloading:
-> increases readability of the program

Different ways to overload the method:
1. by changing number of arguments
2. by changing the data type

NOTE:- In Java, Method overloading is not possible by changing the return type of method only

NOTE:- One type is not de-promoted implicitly, eg. double can't be depromoted to any type implicitly

Polymorphism - Method overriding:
-> if subclass has same method as declared in parent class

Usage of method overriding:
-> used to provide specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass
-> used for runtime polymorphism

Rules for method overriding:
-> method must have same name as in parent class
-> method must have same parameter as in parent class
-> there must be IS-A relationship

Overriding static method?
-> static method can't be overridden
-> static method is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with object
-> static belongs to class area and instance belongs to heap area

Polymorphism - 'super' keyword:
-> It is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object
-> when we create instance of subclass, implicitly parent class instance is created which is referred by super reference variable

Usage of 'super' keyword:
-> used to refer immediate parent class instance variable
-> used to invoke immediate parent class method
-> used to invoke immediate parent class constructor
