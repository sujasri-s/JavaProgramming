OOPs Concepts:
-> Main aim is to implement real-world entities
-> OOPs is methodology or paradigm to design program using classes and objects
-> It simplifies software development and maintenance

Object:
-> It is instance of a class
-> real-world entity/ runtime entity/ entity with state and behavior
-> It is physical as well as logical entity
-> has 3 characteristics - state, behavior, identity

Class:
-> It is group of objects which have common properties
-> It is template/ blueprint from which objects are created
-> It is logical entity
-> It contains Fields, Methods, Constructors, Blocks, Nested class and interface

Instance variable:
-> created inside class and outside method
-> doesn't get memory at compile time but at runtime when object or instance is created

Method:
-> It is function where behavior of object is exposed
-> Advantage is code reusability and optimization

'new' Keyword:
-> used to allocate memory at runtime
-> all objects get memory in heap area

3 ways to initialise object:
1. by reference variable
2. by method
3. by constructor
